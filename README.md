Project Overview

Clustering is a crucial technique in unsupervised machine learning, allowing us to group data points based on their similarity. This project specifically focuses on:

Hierarchical Clustering: Using a dendrogram to visualize the distance between data points.

Agglomerative Clustering: Grouping data points into clusters using bottom-up hierarchical clustering.
The objective of the project is to demonstrate how these clustering methods can be applied to any dataset and to explore how clusters can be formed based on the inherent structure of the data.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.9

Key Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib: For visualizing dendrograms and other plots

scipy: For hierarchical clustering.

sklearn: For agglomerative clustering and other machine learning tasks.
