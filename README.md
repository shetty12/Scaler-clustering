**Clustering Analysis Project**
This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques to identify natural groupings in a dataset using Pythonâ€™s data science libraries. The project leverages both hierarchical and agglomerative clustering techniques for data analysis and visualization.


**Project Overview**
Clustering is a key technique in unsupervised machine learning, allowing us to group data points based on their similarity. This project focuses on two clustering approaches:

Hierarchical Clustering: A technique used to build a dendrogram for visualizing the proximity between data points.

Agglomerative Clustering: A bottom-up approach where each data point starts in its own cluster and pairs of clusters are merged.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate these clustering methods on a dataset, and explore the formation of clusters based on the inherent data structure.

**Technologies Used**
**Programming Language**: Python 3.9
**Libraries**:

**pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

**matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.

**scipy**: For hierarchical clustering methods.

**scikit-learn**: For implementing agglomerative clustering.
